# LinkedIn-Bot
A simple bot that connects with new people related to a keyword and sends a message with the connection request


## Getting Started

Within the code please add your username, password, keyword and message. Also change the page numbers you want to search through.

Please note:
- Do not overuse this code as it will result in action being taken against your account
- This code cannot bypass any security verification upon login (often appears after repeated use)
- Keep the range of pages searched on any one request <10 
- Avoid including the first 2 pages on any search as LinkedIn pushes recommended people 
- This bot only sends connection requests to people who want to be connected with rather than have a 'follow' option


### Prerequisites

Please install the following packages in comand prompt to begin:
* selenium
  ```sh
  python -m pip install selenium
  ```
* webdriver-manager
  ```sh
  python -m pip install webdriver-manager
  ```
